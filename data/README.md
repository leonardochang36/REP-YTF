__NOTE:__ Please, first unzip _imgGallery_VGG.mat_ and _VGG.mat_ files.


The VGG-Face descriptors were extracted from the YTF database.  Specifically, VGG.mat corresponds to the VGG-Face descriptors for all videos of the YTF database, and imgGallery_VGG.mat are the VGG-Face descriptors for the best image (frame) of each video of the YTF database.  

These features are just provided for a demo. They are not state of the art features, so you are suggested to use or design a better feature representation. To extract your own features, make sure to use the video list contained in the configuration file to determine the video order, as well as the image gallery list to construct the gallery for video-to-image scenario.
